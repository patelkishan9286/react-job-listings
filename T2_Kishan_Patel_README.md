# Deployment

Here's a summary of the steps I performed to deploy my project to Netlify:

- **Step 1**: I created a copy of my GitLab repository on my personal GitHub account. This step is necessary because Netlify does not support direct deployment from GitLab.

- **Step 2**: I created an account on Netlify by visiting their website and following the registration process. Then, I provided the required information and verified my account by confirming my email address.

- **Step 3**: After signing up and verifying my account, I was redirected to a quick import page on Netlify. Here, I clicked on "import an existing project.". I authorized Netlify to connect to my personal GitHub account, granting it the necessary permissions.

- **Step 4**: I selected the specific repository, branch and build options for my project on Netlify.

- **Step 5**: Finally, I'm done! Netlify starts deploying my site, and within a few minutes, my front-end starter application is live and accessible. I can view the deployed site and share the provided URL with others as and when required.

These steps allow me to easily deploy my front-end application using Netlify, leveraging the capabilities of GitHub and Netlify's seamless integration.
